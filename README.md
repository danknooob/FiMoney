## ⚡ Quick Start

### 1. Clone the repository
```sh
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd FiMoney
```

### 2. Backend Setup
```sh
cd backend
npm install
# Create a .env file (see .env.example)
npm start
```
- The backend runs on `http://localhost:8080` by default.

### 3. Frontend Setup
```sh
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
- The frontend runs on `http://localhost:5173` by default.

## 🔑 Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the `backend` folder:
```
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
PORT=8080
```

For the frontend, you can set the API URL in a `.env` file (optional):
```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
```

## 📚 API Documentation
- Swagger UI: [http://localhost:8080/api-docs](http://localhost:8080/api-docs)
- See `backend/swagger.json` for full OpenAPI spec.

### Main Endpoints
- `POST   /register` and `/api/auth/register` – Register a new user
- `POST   /login` and `/api/auth/login` – Login and get JWT
- `POST   /products` and `/api/products` – Add a product (auth required)
- `PUT    /products/:id/quantity` and `/api/products/:id/quantity` – Update product quantity (auth required)
- `GET    /products` and `/api/products` – List products (auth required, paginated)

## 🧪 Testing

### Automated API Test Script

A Python test script is provided to verify all backend endpoints.

#### **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.6+
- `requests` library (`pip install requests`)

#### **How to Run**
1. Make sure your backend server is running (`npm start` in the `backend` folder).
2. In a new terminal, navigate to the test folder:
   ```sh
   cd test
   python test_api.py
   ```
3. The script will run a series of tests for registration, login, product creation, quantity update, and product listing.

#### **Expected Output**
- Each test will print PASSED or FAILED, with details if a test fails.
- Example:
  ```
  User Registration: PASSED
  Login Test: PASSED
  Add Product: PASSED
  Update Quantity: PASSED, Updated quantity: 15
  Get Products: PASSED (Quantity = 15)
  ```



#### **Troubleshooting**
- If you see 404 errors, make sure your backend exposes both `/register` and `/api/auth/register` (and similar for other endpoints).
- If you see 401 errors, check your JWT secret and token handling.
- If you see 500 errors, check your backend terminal for stack traces.

## 🚀 Deployment
- You can deploy the backend (Render, Heroku, etc.) and frontend (Vercel, Netlify, etc.) easily.
- Make sure to update your environment variables for production.
